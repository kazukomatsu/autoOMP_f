INSTALLATION GUIDE

1. Some environmental variables such as LD_LIBRARY_PATH must be
   correctly set so as to use ROSE.

   For example, for Darwin,
   
   % export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/opt/rose-0.9.5a/lib:~/opt/boost-1.47/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH

   For Linux,

   % export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/opt/rose-0.9.5a/lib:~/opt/boost-1.47/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
   

2. Modify makefile for your environment.

   You need to specify header files and libraries of ROSE and Boost.
   You can use the example of Makefiles for Linux and Darwin as a template.

3. Run the GNU make command.

   To compile the package,

   % make
